[basic theorem prover]
we have the following clauses in our initial set!
0 P(_c_foyfod)
1 ~P(_v_diygdrmtxrka)
clauses P(_c_foyfod) and ~P(_c_foyfod) get resolution rule applied on P(_c_foyfod) and on ~P(_c_foyfod)
[ADD] the resulting clause  is added to the set of clauses
proved by deriving the empty clause!
